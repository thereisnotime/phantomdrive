Phantomdrive is open source encrypted USB drive with a stealth mechanism to hide its second partition. To decrypt it you write a keyfile to the drive — the raw contents of the file are used to derive an AES-256 key. The drive automatically unmounts itself, remounts the remaining disk and encrypts and decrypts in place. It uses CH569W SoC, which has USB3, SDIO and an AES hardware block. It is programmable over USB using the `wch-ch56x-isp` library.

``` bash
|-- ee             # Hardware files
|-- Makefile
|-- readme.md      # This files
|-- test           # Test the cypto components

```

# Getting Started
``` bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout --force
cd wch-ch56x-isp
make # Build the ISP tool
```

## Install the toolchain
The HydraUSB3 project requires a patched GCC that supports the
`WCH-Interrupt-fast` interrupt attribute. Download the xpack GCC from the HydraUSB3 project:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -sL -o riscv-gcc-xpack.tar.gz \
  "https://github.com/hydrausb3/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/download/12.2.0-1/xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-12.2.0-1-linux-x64.tar.gz"
tar xzf riscv-gcc-xpack.tar.gz
sudo cp -r xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-12.2.0-1/* /usr/local/
```

## Debugging
```
make UART=1 # Enable UART
make UART=1 DEBUG_USB=1 # Enable USB Debugging
```

## Build and Flashing the project
``` bash
make
# Remove flash drive
# While holding boot button, plug in
./wch-ch56x-isp/wch-ch56x-isp -d=off # This is needed just one to disable debug mode
make flash
```

## Unlocking Drive

Generate a keyfile once and store it somewhere safe:
``` bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=~/phantomdrive.key bs=64 count=1
```

Copy it to the drive each time you want to unlock:
``` bash
sudo cp ~/phantomdrive.key /mnt/unlock.key
```

The entire file contents are used as raw key material. Using random bytes from `/dev/urandom` rather than a memorable password prevents dictionary attacks against the key derivation function.

# Releasing the hardware
``` bash
./scripts/release_hardware.sh
```
